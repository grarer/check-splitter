# Check Splitter

When my family goes out to eat, usually one person pays the check and then sends Cash App requests for each other person's share. This is a little web-app tool to calculate each person's contribution and split the taxes, fees, and tips proportionally to each person's share of the subtotal. For items belonging to multiple people, the cost is split evenly between them - useful when the whole table shares an appetizer, or two out of four people split a pizza.
